# Week 8 Assessment — The Capstone (Terminal Assessment of the Camp)

This is the last thing you will be graded on, and it is the only thing the camp was ever building
toward. Weeks 1 through 4 handed you a toolkit; Weeks 5 and 6 taught you to read an estimator in a
stranger's hands and to build a measurement honestly; Week 7 made you design a falsifiable question
of your own and file the pre-analysis plan and identification memo that froze it before the data
could flatter you. Week 8 is where that frozen plan becomes a *paper a hostile referee cannot
ambush, packaged so a stranger can rebuild every number with one command.* The Week-7 assessment
graded the design half and told you, in plain words, that its rubric *is* the rubric your capstone
meets. This assessment is that promise come due. It extends the Week-7 research-design rubric to the
full project: not just "is the plan one a referee could not ambush?" but "did you execute it
honestly, stress-test it until it nearly died, write it so a stranger believes it, and ship it so a
stranger can check you?"

**Total: 200 points** across four deliverables and seven rubric rows. The standard is the one this
whole book has pressed since Chapter 1.5: *a modest result you have stress-tested honestly outscores
an ambitious one you cannot defend.* A capstone that writes, unprompted, "my Oster $\hat\delta$ is
0.4, so an unobservable weaker than my controls could explain the result, and I report it as a robust
association, not a causal effect" earns more than one that claims a clean causal effect from the same
data. Hold yourself to CONVENTIONS §4 (every spec named in seven-slot form) and §5 (the repo runs on
a fresh env, the environment is pinned, licensed data stays on GMU infrastructure, no secret ever
appears in code) throughout — those are not extra credit, they are the floor.

Before you start, read one finished example in the **capstone gallery** (`book/capstones/`): five
complete student papers, each with its talk and its one-click packet — Fair Lending on HMDA, Common
Ownership from 13F, Innovation from USPTO, SEC 8-K Text Classification, and a FRED macro event study.
Read one not for its result but for its *seams*: find its identification slide, find the
residual-concern its threats table admits, and run its `make all`. That is the bar you are clearing.

## How you submit

The four deliverables below are *one* thing seen from four sides: the paper is the argument, the
packet is the proof, the talk is the defense, and the disclosure is the honesty. You submit them
together as the single Git repository you have been committing into since Lab 7 — the `pap-filed`
tag still in its history, the confirmatory commit dated after it, `DEVIATIONS.md` filled in, the
compiled `paper/main.pdf` and the slide deck both regenerable by the same `run_all` that produces
your results. There is no separate "final upload": the repository *is* the submission, and the first
thing a grader does is clone it and type one command. Everything else — the rubric below, the
question period — is downstream of whether that command works. Treat the week as the assembly job it
is, not as five new things to build: every piece already exists from Weeks 7 and 8; the capstone is
the act of making them hold together under a stranger's hands.

## The four deliverables

### D1 — The final paper (12–20 pp, AEA LaTeX format)

A complete empirical-finance paper, compiled to PDF from the AEA LaTeX template variant (Lab 8), in
the fixed skeleton of Chapter 8.3: **introduction · literature · data · empirical design /
identification · results · robustness · conclusion**, with the bibliography at the back and every
table and figure built to **Appendix D**. The non-negotiable contents, each tied to where you learned
it:

- **An introduction that promises** (Ch 8.3 §2): a hook that leads with a fact and a stake, a
  one-sentence contribution with a verb calibrated to your design (Ch 8.3 §3, §7), a "we find"
  preview giving the headline number in human units, and a roadmap. The introduction must stand alone
  — a reader who stops there walks away with the question, the answer, and the right confidence.
- **A literature review that positions, not enumerates** (Ch 8.3 §4): the gap *constructed* by
  grouping and contrasting strands, every citation load-bearing, every reference verified or tagged
  `[CHECK]` per CONVENTIONS §6 — a hallucinated citation is the one error a referee catches in ten
  seconds and never forgives.
- **A design section built on the identifying-assumption sentence** (Ch 8.3 §5, from your Ch 7.5
  memo): the estimating equation written out in CONVENTIONS §3 notation; the spec named in §4
  seven-slot form (outcome · key regressor · controls · fixed effects · clustering · sample ·
  identifying assumption in one sentence); and **the identifying-assumption sentence + the
  four-column threats-and-responses table** carried in verbatim, threats ordered by descending danger,
  a statistic in column 3 for every *testable* threat and an argument for every *arguable* one, no
  residual-concern cell empty.
- **A results section that leads with the headline table** (Ch 8.3 §5), interpreted economically
  (is the effect big enough to *matter*, not just to be significant?), then the secondary results.
- **A specification curve and a robustness battery** (Ch 8.1, 8.2): the multiverse of defensible
  specifications plotted with your pre-registered point marked, plus the battery that operationalizes
  column 3 of your threats table — placebos (in-time, in-space, fake-outcome), the standard-error
  panel and the wild cluster bootstrap where treated clusters are few, sensitivity to the knobs your
  result could be hostage to, the multiple-testing correction (Bonferroni / Benjamini–Hochberg) for
  your *pre-specified* family, and **Oster (2019) $\delta$** with its $R_{\max}$ defended and swept.
- **A conclusion that recalibrates** (Ch 8.3 §6): the finding in its hedged form, an honest
  limitations paragraph promoting the residual-concern column into prose, and a "what's next."

The paper is graded on the *argument*, not the transcript (Ch 8.3 §1). Length is 12–20 pages
including tables and figures; padding to reach 20 is a tell, as is cramming a real project into 8.

### D2 — The GitHub replication packet (verified by `make clean && make all`)

The six-part packet of Chapter 8.5, finishing the Lab-7 repository:

1. **Data or a data-access script.** Public data ships cached with its vintage pinned; licensed data
   (CRSP, Compustat, Bloomberg, WRDS) does *not* ship — it stays read-only on GMU infrastructure, and
   the packet carries the pinned access script in `src/` plus a `logs/pulls.jsonl` with content
   hashes so a reviewer with access re-pulls identical bytes. The README states which is which.
2. **Code in run-order** — `01_pull.py`, `02_build.py`, `03_analysis.py`, … — logic in `src/`, story
   in `notebooks/`, the order unambiguous.
3. **A README** — what / why / how-to-run — whose run section has collapsed to *one line*.
4. **A pinned environment** — human-readable `environment.yml` (`python=3.11` + the §5 stack) and the
   machine-exact `environment.lock.yml`.
5. **A fixed, named SEED** set once and threaded through every stochastic step (bootstrap,
   permutation, split), recorded in the README so a reviewer knows it was fixed *before* results, not
   tuned after.
6. **A single `make` / `run_all` entry point.** `make all` regenerates every table and figure from
   raw bytes to compiled PDF, with tables and figures *generated by code, never pasted by hand.* The
   honesty test, and the standard this row is graded against, is literally `make clean && make all`:
   delete every derived file and rebuild from nothing. If the PDF comes back identical, the packet is
   real; if a number drifts, you have a hand-edit, and you found it before a reviewer did.

### D3 — The 8-minute presentation + defense

The six-beat arc of Chapter 8.5 §1 — **question → why it matters → design/identification → headline
result → robustness → contribution** — one idea per slide, every result you say out loud translated
from a table into a *figure* (point-with-error-bar, coefficient plot, event-study plot, RD binned
scatter), rehearsed timed to fit in *seven* minutes with a pre-decided cut line. The defense is
graded as hard as the talk: the questions are the rows of your Chapter 7.5 threats table, so you
answer in threat → why-plausible → what-you-did → residual-concern order, you give a *located* "I
don't know" when you cannot answer, and you can tell a survivable critique (it attacks a number) from
a fatal one (it attacks the comparison) and concede the fatal one honestly rather than bluff.

### D4 — The responsible-AI-use disclosure (from Week 6)

A short disclosure (Ch 6.5 / Assessment 6 B4) stating, by category, where AI tools touched the work:
**label generation or any AI-produced data needs a validation table; prose editing is disclosed but
needs no validation; AI-suggested citations are the most dangerous and must be independently verified
or tagged `[CHECK]`.** This is the camp's honesty norm made explicit, and per CONVENTIONS §5 no key
or secret appears anywhere — environment variables only.

## The analytic rubric (200 points, allocations explicit)

Each row is scored at one of four levels. The rubric extends the Week-7 research-design rubric to the
whole project and is weighted, by design, toward **identification and threats**, **execution and
robustness**, and **reproducibility** — because those, not the eventual coefficient, are what make a
capstone defensible. The first two rows carry forward the Week-7 weights (they are the design half you
already filed); the new weight goes to *honest execution*.

| Criterion | Excellent | Proficient | Developing | Missing | Pts |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Research question & contribution** (Ch 8.3 §2–§4). One-sentence contribution naming a recognizable job (first / overturn / reconcile / mechanism / new data) with a verb calibrated to the design; literature review *constructs* the gap by contrast; every citation load-bearing and verified. | Contribution clear and calibrated, but one slip: a slightly over-claimed verb, or one strand of the lit review enumerated rather than contrasted. | Contribution present but vague or a transcript-style "we run a regression on X"; lit review is an annotated bibliography. | No findable contribution sentence, or a fabricated/unverifiable citation, or "first" claimed where prior work did the same. | **30** |
| **Identification & threats** (Ch 7.5 → Ch 8.3 §5). Assumption sentence names the *effect* and the *specific threat* (never "endogeneity"), with the verb (*causal* vs. *credible*) calibrated to the evidence; threats table pulls the right design menu, adds data-specific threats, **matches a statistic to every testable threat and an argument to every arguable one**, leaves no residual cell empty, ordered by descending danger. | Strong, but one slip: verb slightly overclaimed, one response mismatched to threat-nature, or one thin/"none" residual cell. | Assumption vague ("controlling for confounders") or table missing the menu threats, several blank residuals, or testable/arguable confused. | No named assumption (or it says "endogeneity"), or no threats table, or every residual is "none." | **34** |
| **Execution & robustness** (Ch 8.1, 8.2). Pre-registered spec run *once* and reported whichever way it fell; specification curve with the pre-registered point marked and read by the §8.1.3 checklist; robustness battery operationalizes column 3 — correct SE flavor (clustered where treatment varies) **and** wild cluster bootstrap if treated clusters are few; placebos; sensitivity sweeps; **Oster $\delta$ with $R_{\max}$ defended and swept to 1**; a *failed* check reported as a finding that narrows the claim. | Battery present and mostly correct, but one gap: spec curve unmarked, $R_{\max}$ asserted without the sweep, or one obvious placebo missing. | Some robustness but key checks absent or misread (few-cluster ignored, $\delta$ with no $R_{\max}$, failed check buried), or a starred number kept after the bootstrap killed it. | No spec curve / no battery, or the confirmatory result was tuned post-hoc (freeze broken), or only-passing checks shown with the scary one omitted. | **40** |
| **Writing & table craft** (Ch 8.3 §1, §6, §8 + Appendix D). Argument not transcript; headline-first at every scale; verbs match the weakest assumption with no causal-language *drift*; tables stand alone (named SE flavor, defined stars, disclosed FE/clustering/$N$, sensible digits) per Appendix D; robustness organized around the reader's doubts. | Clean and self-contained, but one lapse: a verb that drifts in one section, or one table missing a disclosure row. | Several lapses: causal drift across sections, data-dump results, tables that need the prose to be intelligible. | Unreadable, or overclaims throughout, or tables hand-formatted and inconsistent with the text. | **30** |
| **Reproducibility — the one-click packet** (Ch 8.5 + CONVENTIONS §5). `make clean && make all` rebuilds every table/figure to PDF from raw on a fresh clone; tables/figures generated by code, never pasted; env pinned (`.yml` + `.lock.yml`); SEED fixed, named, threaded; licensed data recipe-reproducible and kept on GMU infra; **no secret anywhere**. | Rebuilds and is pinned, but one element thin: SEED set but not threaded everywhere, or one figure pasted, or the licensed-data split undocumented. | A re-run would fail: `make all` errors or skips a step, no pinned lock file, or some numbers hand-copied so the chain breaks. | `make clean && make all` does not reproduce the paper, OR a hard-coded key/secret appears anywhere (this alone caps the row at Missing). | **34** |
| **Presentation & defense** (Ch 8.5 §1–§4). The six-beat arc, one idea per slide, results translated to figures, fits the time; the defense answers questions as threats-table rows, gives a *located* "I don't know," and concedes a fatal critique rather than bluffing. | Solid talk and defense, but one slip: ran slightly long, one table shown where a figure belonged, or one bluffed answer. | Talk delivers the result but the design slide is weak; the defense dodges or over-defends a critique it should have conceded. | No coherent arc, or the defense bluffs a fatal critique / cannot state the design's weakness. | **22** |
| **Honesty & disclosure** (whole project + Ch 6.5 / D4). The confirmatory/exploratory line is drawn in public (DEVIATIONS.md, labeled exploratory analyses); limitations stated as intrinsic vs. fixable; the AI-use disclosure is complete and category-correct (validation table for AI-produced data, citations verified). | Honesty present, but one thin spot: a deviation logged without the outcome-driven verdict, or a disclosure category slightly vague. | Several lapses: overclaims the design, an outcome-driven deviation passed off as confirmatory, or an incomplete AI disclosure. | Hides a deviation, presents a searched result as a test, or omits/falsifies the AI-use disclosure. | **10** |

**Total: 200 points.** The rows sum to 30 + 34 + 40 + 30 + 34 + 22 + 10 = **200**. The three
design-and-execution-craft rows — identification & threats (34), execution & robustness (40), and the
one-click packet (34) — sum to **108**, more than half the grade, by design: what makes a capstone
defensible is the craft, not the coefficient. The two heaviest single rows, *execution & robustness*
(40) and *identification & threats* (34), are the two questions a referee asks first and the two this
camp spent eight weeks teaching you to answer about your own work before anyone else can.

## Instructor guidance and grading key

This is an open-ended terminal deliverable on each student's own project, so the key is a set of
*standards*, anchor papers, and the bright lines that separate the levels — not an answer sheet.

**The two highest-signal things to grade**, the same two from Week 7 now joined by execution: (1)
**Was there exactly one pre-registered primary specification, run once on the confirmation data and
reported whichever way it fell**, with the `pap-filed` tag predating any confirmatory commit? Check
the Git history; a starred headline that postdates no tag, or a primary spec that mutated after the
first look, breaks the contract and caps *execution & robustness* at Developing. (2) **Does
`make clean && make all` actually rebuild the paper's numbers on a fresh clone?** Run it. This is not
a formality — it is the row, and it is the single most objective thing in the rubric. A packet that
does not rebuild caps reproducibility at Developing; a hard-coded secret caps it at Missing on its own
per CONVENTIONS §5.

**How to grade fairly.** Grade the project the student *chose to write*, not the one you would have
written (the refereeing asymmetry of Ch 8.4 §1). Ambition is not the axis — a clean OLS-on-observables
study that honestly reports its Oster $\delta$ and labels its claim "robust association" is an A
project; an ambitious DiD that overclaims "causes" with a blank residual column is not. Calibrate
against the gallery: each of the five capstones is a worked anchor at the A/A− line. Grade each row
independently against the level descriptors, then sum; do not let a brilliant talk inflate a packet
that does not rebuild, and do not let one missing placebo sink an otherwise honest battery — that is
what the four-level structure is for.

**The line between an A and a B capstone.** Both run a real design on real data, find a result, and
write it up cleanly; the bones are sound for both. The difference is *honest stress-testing under
pressure*. The A capstone marks its pre-registered point on the spec curve and it sits near the
center; it reports the check that *failed* and narrows the claim accordingly; its Oster $\delta$ comes
with a defended $R_{\max}$ and a sweep to 1; `make clean && make all` rebuilds byte-for-byte; and in
the defense the student concedes the one fatal critique rather than bluffing and can state precisely
where their own design is weakest. The B capstone runs the battery but only shows the passes, asserts
$R_{\max}$ without the sweep, leaves the spec-curve point unmarked, has a packet that rebuilds "after
one fix," and in the defense argues harder when it should concede. The B is not dishonest — it simply
has not yet internalized that a failed check is a finding and a conceded critique is a strength. That
internalization is the whole point of the camp, and it is the A.

**Common failure modes**, the classic capstone ways to lose points:
(a) *Transcript, not argument* — a chronological "first I downloaded, then I cleaned, then I tried
three specs" with no headline-first structure; cap *writing & table craft* (Ch 8.3 §1).
(b) *Causal-language drift* — abstract hedges, conclusion claims "proves"; read only the verbs
attached to the main result across sections and force them to the weakest assumption (Ch 8.3 §7).
(c) *The robustness section that only passes* — a battery with no failed check reads as *less*
credible, because the grader assumes the student did not try hard enough to fail (Ch 8.2 §6); the
scary placebo for the top-ranked threat must be present whether or not it passed.
(d) *The few-clusters illusion* — three conventional stars on a treatment with eight treated clusters
and no wild cluster bootstrap; if the bootstrap was run and disagreed, the stars must be dropped, and
keeping them caps *execution & robustness* (Ch 8.2 §1).
(e) *Oster $\delta$ without $R_{\max}$* — uninterpretable; a $\delta$ reported without its $R_{\max}$
and a sweep to 1 is a non-answer (Ch 8.2 §5).
(f) *The pasted number* — a table or figure copied by hand so the chain breaks and `make clean &&
make all` does not reproduce it; this is the most common reproducibility failure and it caps the
packet row (Ch 8.5 §5).
(g) *The freeze broken* — a confirmatory coefficient that postdates no tag or mutated after peeking;
the p-value no longer means what Chapter 1.5 says, and the result is a search dressed as a test.
(h) *A hard-coded secret* — caps reproducibility at Missing on its own, no exceptions, per §5.

**How the rubric maps to the publication standard.** This capstone is calibrated to the real-program
bar: outputs published in the **Schar / NextGen Young Scholars Journal** and deposited in the **GMU
MARS** repository (Articulation Matrix; CONVENTIONS §8). An *Excellent* across the identification,
execution, writing, and reproducibility rows is, concretely, a paper that would survive a first-round
referee at that venue: a credible (not overclaimed) identifying assumption with a threats table that
disarms the obvious attacks, a robustness battery that a referee would otherwise demand in round two,
tables to a journal style guide (Appendix D), and a one-click packet that satisfies a data-availability
policy. The MARS deposit standard *is* the reproducibility row: a stranger clones the repo, types one
command, and the deposited paper rebuilds from the deposited data and code. Grade to that standard,
because that is where the strongest of these papers are actually headed.

### What a top capstone looks like, in one paragraph

It opens with a hook that leads with a fact and a stake and a one-sentence contribution whose verb is
calibrated to a design the literature review has shown to fill a real, *constructed* gap; it states
the estimating equation and the identifying-assumption sentence (effect named, specific threat named,
verb honest) with a threats table that leads with the most dangerous row, matches a statistic to every
testable threat and an argument to every arguable one, and leaves no residual cell empty; it runs the
pre-registered spec once and reports it whichever way it fell, surrounds it with a specification curve
whose marked pre-registered point sits near the center, and a robustness battery that includes the
scary placebo and an Oster $\delta$ with a defended, swept $R_{\max}$ — reporting honestly the one
check that narrowed the claim; it leads its results with the headline table interpreted in human
units, hedges its verbs to its weakest assumption with no drift, and builds every table to Appendix D;
it ships as a repo where `make clean && make all` rebuilds the PDF from raw data through seeded code
with no secret anywhere; it is defended in eight minutes of figures-not-tables with the design slide
as the spine, and in the question period the student answers from their own threats table, gives a
located "I don't know," and concedes the one fatal critique rather than bluffing; and it discloses,
by category, exactly where AI touched the work. That capstone can say the sentence the whole camp
existed to let a student say truthfully: *"Here is what I found, here is exactly why you should believe
it, and here is the command that lets you check me."* That is an original empirical paper. That is the
A.
